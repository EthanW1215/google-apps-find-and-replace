# google-apps-find-and-replace
Designed by myself for my High School AP Statistics class. The program uses a Google spreadsheet to fill in data on a Google Doc template. It is designed to fill in the name and home room number of the addressee on 160 surveys, to be printed and delivered. 

<b>Do you need to import spreadsheet data (i.e. Name and Address) into a Google Doc template, creating a new page for each interation? If so, you may find this program of use.</b>

Use cases: Mailing lists (physical mail, not email), personalized handouts/memos, etc.

The program is written using Google Apps Script, which can be very difficult to learn due to somewhat messy documentation. This application can be adapted to fit your purposes, provided you understand basic JS. No need to waste hours pouring over documentation intended for a use case different than yours. 

I don't feel great about how I had to add elements to each new page created (adding each child individually), but I couldn't find any other way to do this. If you think you have a better method, you're probably wrong, trust me. GAS does not play well with logic. If you do develop a better method, I'd be both amazed and greatfull. Feel free to send a pull request.

If you need to tweek a few things and need help, I'm happy to do what I can. I'm still in Highschool though, so don't expect me to take any less than 6 hours to solve a problem involving 10 minutes of actual coding. 

Hope someone is able to get some use out of this.

Here is a link to a video I made explaining how to use the program to my fellow AP Stats Students: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL8PV9bdUzE
